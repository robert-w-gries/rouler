//! # rouler - A container-like system for generating dice rolls
//!
//! [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/rouler.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/rouler)
//!
//! rouler is a library for handling repeatable dice rolls in a conveniently storable way.
//! At the heart of rouler is the `Roller`, a simple struct that contains both the syntax for a specific
//! dice roll, and the result of the most recent roll. This allows you to store a particular roll
//! type in a variable, that can then be passed around (within the limits of mutable values), and
//! repeated via method calls as needed. It is meant to be useful for CRPGs and tabletop game aids.
//!
//! ## Example usage
//!
//! ```
//! use rouler::Roller;
//!
//! let mut stat = Roller::new("3d6");
//!
//! println!("STR: {}", stat.total());
//! println!("DEX: {}", stat.reroll());
//! ```
//!
//! ## The Die Roll Syntax
//!
//! rouler uses parsed strings to define die rolls, according to the following [pest](https://github.com/dragostis/pest/)
//! grammar found in `parse.rs`, with some additional rules checking:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! expression = _{
//!     { ["("] ~ expression ~ [")"] | number }
//!     addition       = { plus  | minus }
//!     multiplication = { times | slash }
//!     die_roll       = { roll }
//! }
//! number = @{ ["-"]? ~ (["0"] | ['1'..'9'] ~ ['0'..'9']*) }
//! plus   =  { ["+"] }
//! minus  =  { ["-"] }
//! times  =  { ["*"] }
//! slash  =  { ["/"] }
//! roll   =  { ["d"] | ["D"] }
//!
//! whitespace = _{ [" "] }
//! ```
//!
//! Largely this should all be familiar basic mathematical notation, the key addition being the `d` operator,
//! which operates according to the standard notation familiar from tabletop RPGs, ie.:
//!
//! `n[d|D]s`, where `n` = the number of dice to roll, and `s` = the number of sides on each die.
//!
//! There are additional constraints checked for in this operator alone as well: neither `n` or `s` can be zero,
//! and `s` cannot be a negative number. `n` is allowed to be negative, but rather than rolling "negative dice",
//! this merely negates the value of the entire roll, such that `-3d6` would generate a value between -3 and -18.
//!
